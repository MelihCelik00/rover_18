# ITU ROVER ROBOTIC ARM INVERSE CALCULATIONS
This branch consists of inverse kinematic calculations of ITU Rover's robotic arm. The main calculations are located on "robotic_arm.py" .
Addition to the main calculations, there are some test calculations and basic simulations in circular_motion_main.py

# TODO: By iteration method, determine robotic arm endpoint's workspace export it as point cloud.
# TODO: PS4 integration must be developed.
# INFO: Additional "TODO'S" are located in project files.
