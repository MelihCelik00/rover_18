# ITU ROVER ROBOTIC ARM INVERSE CALCULATIONS
This branch consists of inverse kinematic calculations of ITU Rover's robotic arm. The main calculations are located on "robotic_arm.py" .

Addition to the main calculations, there are some test calculations and basic simulations in circular_motion_main.py

## Prerequisities
Some python packages are needed to be installed such as:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pygame - This package is necessary for controlling the main.py simulation with ps4 controller.


## Simply to run example simulation
```
python circular_motion_main.py
```

## TODO

* By iteration method, determine robotic arm endpoint's workspace export it as point cloud.

* PS4 integration must be developed.

* Additional "TODO'S" are located in project files.
